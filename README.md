# intellidocs: A Documentation Tracking Demonstration

This project, `intellidocs`, serves as a demonstration of a system capable of tracking changes and additions to project documentation.  While currently a simple example, it highlights the core concept of automatically updating documentation based on code modifications.  This README provides an overview of the project.


## Key Features and Capabilities

* **Documentation Tracking (Demonstration):**  The primary focus is showcasing the ability to monitor code changes and reflect these in associated documentation.  The current implementation is a basic proof-of-concept.
* **Extensibility:** The design allows for expansion to include more sophisticated features such as automated documentation generation, version control integration, and more robust change tracking.


## Technology Stack

* **Python:** The core language used for this demonstration.


## Quick Start Guide

1. **Clone the Repository:**  Obtain a copy of the project using Git:  (replace with actual repo URL if applicable)  `git clone <repository_url>`

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:** `cd intellidocs`

3. **Run the Example:** Execute the `helloworld.py` script: `python helloworld.py`

This will print "Hello World!" to the console, demonstrating the basic functionality.  Further development would involve integrating a documentation tracking mechanism to automatically update associated documentation based on changes in `helloworld.py` or other added files.


## Project Structure Overview

The project currently consists of a single directory:

* **`/` (root):** Contains the `helloworld.py` file and this README.md.

Future iterations may include additional directories for organizing different aspects of the system (e.g., documentation, API, etc.).


## Links to Detailed Documentation

Detailed documentation will be added as the project evolves.  For now, this README serves as the primary source of information.


## Future Enhancements

* **Automated Documentation Generation:**  Integrate tools to automatically generate documentation from code comments or docstrings.
* **Version Control Integration:** Connect to version control systems (like Git) to track changes more effectively.
* **Advanced Change Tracking:**  Implement mechanisms for detailed change logging and reporting.
* **User Interface:**  Develop a user-friendly interface for viewing and managing documentation.


This project is currently in its early stages and serves as a basic demonstration. The potential for expanding its capabilities is significant.
