# intellidocs: Intelligent Document Processing (Conceptual)

This project, intellidocs, is a conceptual framework for intelligent document processing.  While the specifics of its functionality are not fully defined, the core goal is to provide tools and utilities for efficient handling and analysis of various document types.  The current implementation focuses on Git integration for document version control and management.  Further development will explore advanced features such as NLP and machine learning for automated document understanding.

## Key Features and Capabilities (Planned & Current)

**Current Capabilities:**

* **Git Integration:**  Provides functionality to interact with Git repositories, enabling version control of documents.  This includes basic operations like cloning, committing, and pushing changes. (See `src/git_operations.py`)

**Planned Features:**

* **Document Parsing:**  Ability to parse various document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT) and extract key information.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Integration with NLP libraries for text analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic extraction.
* **Machine Learning (ML):**  Use of ML models for tasks such as document classification, named entity recognition, and relationship extraction.
* **Document Summarization:**  Generation of concise summaries of lengthy documents.
* **Data Extraction and Transformation:**  Efficiently extracting structured data from unstructured documents and transforming it into usable formats.


## Technology Stack

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **GitPython:** Library for interacting with Git repositories.
* **(Future) NLP Libraries:**  Libraries like spaCy, NLTK, or Transformers (depending on project needs).
* **(Future) ML Libraries:**  Libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch (depending on project needs).


## Quick Start Guide

This project is currently in its early stages of development and does not have a standalone executable or a defined entry point.  To run the existing Git operations code:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.
2. **Install Dependencies:**  Install required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (a `requirements.txt` file should be created listing the dependencies).
3. **(Optional) Configure Git:**  Ensure you have Git installed and configured with your credentials.
4. **Run Example Code:**  Explore and run the example code within `src/git_operations.py`.  Note that this will require you to have a local Git repository or access to a remote repository.
