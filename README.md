# intellidocs: Intelligent Document Processing (Conceptual)

This project, `intellidocs`, is a conceptual framework for intelligent document processing. While the specific functionality is currently undefined, the core aim is to provide tools for efficient handling and analysis of various document formats. This README outlines the planned structure and capabilities.  Further development will define the exact features and capabilities.


## Key Features and Capabilities (Planned)

The `intellidocs` project aims to eventually provide the following capabilities:

* **Document Ingestion:**  Import documents from various sources and formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT).
* **Data Extraction:** Extract key information and metadata from documents using advanced techniques (e.g., OCR, NLP).
* **Document Classification:** Categorize documents based on content and metadata.
* **Data Transformation:** Convert extracted data into structured formats for analysis and storage.
* **Git Integration (Partial Implementation):**  The current implementation includes basic Git operations (see `src/git_operations.py`). This functionality might be expanded to manage document versions and collaborate on document processing workflows.


## Technology Stack

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **GitPython:** For Git repository interaction (currently implemented).


## Quick Start Guide (Conceptual)

This section will be expanded once the project's functionality is fully defined.  Currently, the project is in an early stage of development.
