## Developer Guide: Hello World Project

This guide outlines the contribution process for the "Hello World" project.  While currently simple, this guide establishes a foundation for future growth.


**1. Development Workflow**

1. **Fork the repository:** Create your own fork of the main repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine using `git clone <your_fork_url>`.
3. **Create a branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix using `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.  Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-goodbye-message`, `bugfix/typo-in-greeting`).
4. **Make your changes:** Implement your changes, following the code structure and conventions outlined below.
5. **Commit your changes:** Commit your changes with clear and concise messages.  Use the present tense ("Add goodbye message" not "Added goodbye message").
6. **Push your branch:** Push your branch to your forked repository using `git push origin <branch_name>`.
7. **Create a pull request:** Create a pull request on the main repository, comparing your branch with the `main` branch.  Provide a detailed description of your changes and address any comments from reviewers.

**2. Code Structure and Conventions**

Currently, the project consists solely of `helloworld.py` in the root directory.  As the project evolves, we'll adopt a more structured approach. For now:

* **File Naming:** Use lowercase with underscores (`snake_case`) for file names (e.g., `my_module.py`).
* **Variable Naming:** Use lowercase with underscores (`snake_case`) for variable names (e.g., `greeting_message`).
* **Function Naming:** Use lowercase with underscores (`snake_case`) for function names (e.g., `print_greeting`).
* **Docstrings:** Include docstrings to explain the purpose of functions and modules.  Use triple quotes (`"""Docstring goes here"""`).
* **Linting:**  While not currently enforced, consider using a linter (like `pylint` or `flake8`) to maintain code quality.


**3. Testing Guidelines**

Currently, no tests are in place.  As the project grows, we will implement unit tests using a suitable framework (e.g., `unittest` or `pytest`).  Testing will be a crucial part of future development.

**4. Debugging Tips**

* **`print()` statements:**  Use `print()` statements strategically to inspect variable values and program flow.
* **Python debugger (`pdb`):**  Use the Python debugger (`pdb`) to step through your code line by line.  Insert `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` where you want to start debugging.
* **IDE debuggers:** Most IDEs (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm) have built-in debuggers with more advanced features.

**5. Contributing Guidelines**

* **Before contributing:** Review the existing code and understand the project's overall structure and goals.
* **Focus on small, well-defined tasks:** Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable units.
* **Write clean and well-documented code:** Follow the code structure and conventions outlined above.
* **Test your changes thoroughly:**  Even without formal tests yet, ensure your changes work as expected.
* **Follow the development workflow:** Follow the steps outlined in section 1.

**6. Code Review Process**

Pull requests will be reviewed by other contributors to ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to project standards.  Reviewers will look for:

* **Correctness:** Does the code work as intended?
* **Efficiency:** Is the code efficient and well-optimized?
* **Readability:** Is the code easy to understand and maintain?
* **Style:** Does the code follow the project's coding conventions?
* **Testing:** (Future requirement) Are sufficient tests included?


This guide will be updated as the project evolves.  Contributions to improve this guide are also welcome!
