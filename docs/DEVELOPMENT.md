## Developer Guide: Contributing to [Project Name]

This guide outlines the process for contributing to the [Project Name] project.  Currently, the project focuses on Git operations (based on identified `src/git_operations.py`), but this may expand in the future.

**1. Development Workflow:**

1. **Fork the repository:** Create your own fork of the main repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a branch:** Create a new branch from the `main` branch for your feature or bug fix. Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-new-command`, `bugfix/resolve-merge-conflict`).
3. **Make your changes:** Implement your changes, adhering to the code style and testing guidelines outlined below. Commit your changes frequently with clear and concise commit messages.
4. **Push your branch:** Push your branch to your forked repository.
5. **Create a pull request:** Create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.  Include a clear description of your changes and their purpose.
6. **Address feedback:** Respond to any feedback from code reviewers and make necessary changes.


**2. Code Structure and Conventions:**

* **Project Layout:** Currently, the primary source code resides in the `src` directory.  We will adopt a more structured layout as the project evolves.  For now, maintain a clear and organized structure within `src`.
* **File Naming:** Use lowercase with underscores (`snake_case`) for file names (e.g., `git_operations.py`).
* **Coding Style:**  We will adopt PEP 8 style guidelines.  Use a consistent style throughout the codebase. Tools like `pylint` or `flake8` can help enforce this.
* **Documentation:**  Document your code using docstrings (following PEP 257).  Explain the purpose, parameters, return values, and exceptions of functions and classes.


**3. Testing Guidelines:**

Currently, the project lacks tests.  This is a high priority.  We will implement a comprehensive testing strategy using a suitable framework (e.g., `pytest`).  Until then, thorough manual testing is essential.  For future contributions, the following should be followed:

* **Write tests first (TDD):**  Before writing any code, write unit tests to define the expected behavior.
* **Aim for high test coverage:** Strive for a high percentage of code coverage to ensure that changes don't introduce regressions.
* **Test-driven development:**  Use TDD to ensure that features are thoroughly tested.
* **Integration tests:** As the project grows, integration tests will become vital.

**4. Debugging Tips:**

* **`print()` statements:** For simple debugging, use `print()` statements to inspect variable values.
* **Logging:** Use the Python `logging` module for more robust logging, especially in larger projects.
* **Debuggers:**  Use a debugger like `pdb` (Python Debugger) or an IDE's built-in debugger to step through the code and inspect variables.
* **Error messages:** Carefully examine error messages to identify the source of the problem.


**5. Contributing Guidelines:**

* **Issue tracking:** Before starting any work, check if an issue already exists for the problem you want to address. If not, create a new issue with a clear description.
* **Feature requests:**  Clearly describe the intended functionality of any new features.
* **Code quality:** Adhere to the code style guidelines and strive to write clean, well-documented code.
* **Respectful communication:** Be respectful and constructive in all communications.


**6. Code Review Process:**

All pull requests will be reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged.  Reviewers will consider:

* **Functionality:** Does the code work as expected?
* **Code quality:** Is the code clean, efficient, and well-documented?
* **Testing:** Are there sufficient tests to cover the changes?
* **Maintainability:** Is the code easy to understand and maintain?
* **Adherence to standards:** Does the code follow the coding style and conventions defined in this guide?


This document will be updated as the project evolves.  Please consult this guide for the latest information.  We welcome your contributions and look forward to working with you.
