## Developer Guide for Project: Git Operations Tool

This guide outlines the development workflow, code style, testing procedures, and contribution process for this project, a utility focused on Git operations (based on the provided analysis, `src/git_operations.py` suggests this focus).  Since the project's scope is currently unclear, this guide provides a general framework adaptable as the project evolves.


**1. Development Workflow:**

1. **Fork the repository:** Create your own fork of the main project repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a branch:**  Branch off from the `main` branch for each new feature or bug fix. Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-commit-message-check`, `bugfix/handle-empty-repo`).
3. **Develop your changes:** Make your code changes on the new branch.  Follow the code structure and conventions outlined below.
4. **Commit your changes:** Commit your code frequently with clear and concise commit messages.  Use the present tense ("Add feature X," not "Added feature X").
5. **Push your branch:** Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
6. **Create a pull request:** Create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.  Include a clear description of your changes and their purpose.
7. **Address feedback:** Respond to code review comments and make necessary changes.
8. **Merge your pull request:** Once the code review is complete and all changes are approved, your pull request will be merged into the main branch.

**2. Code Structure and Conventions:**

* **Directory Structure:** Currently, the code resides in `src/git_operations.py`.  As the project grows, consider structuring the code into more logical modules and sub-packages.  A possible structure might include:
    * `src/`
        * `git_operations/` (contains core Git operation functions)
        * `utils/` (helper functions)
        * `__init__.py`
* **Coding Style:**  Follow PEP 8 style guidelines consistently.  Use a consistent indentation (4 spaces).  Keep functions concise and focused on a single task.
* **Naming Conventions:**  Use descriptive variable and function names (snake_case).  Classes should use PascalCase.
* **Documentation:** Document your code thoroughly using docstrings.  Use the Google style docstring format.


**3. Testing Guidelines:**

Currently, no tests are included.  Implementing tests is crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions.  Add comprehensive unit tests using a suitable testing framework like `pytest`.

* **Unit Tests:**  Focus on testing individual functions and modules in isolation.
* **Integration Tests:** (Optional, for more complex projects) Test the interaction between different modules.
* **Test Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage (ideally 100%, though this might not always be feasible).


**4. Debugging Tips:**

* **Print Statements:** Use `print()` statements strategically to track variable values and the program's execution flow.
* **Logging:** Implement logging for more robust debugging, especially for handling errors and exceptions.
* **Debugging Tools:** Use a debugger like pdb (Python Debugger) to step through your code line by line.
* **IDE Features:** Utilize your IDE's debugging features such as breakpoints, stepping, and variable inspection.


**5. Contributing Guidelines:**

* **Before Contributing:** Review the project's existing codebase, understand its structure and functionality.  Read through the issues and pull requests to get familiar with the project's current development activity.
* **Issue Tracking:** Report bugs and suggest new features using the issue tracker on GitHub. Provide clear and concise descriptions with steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable.
* **Code Quality:** Ensure your code is well-written, well-documented, and follows the coding conventions outlined above.
* **License:** By contributing, you agree to license your code under the project's license (specify license if not already defined).


**6. Code Review Process:**

* **Pull Request Reviews:** All pull requests will be reviewed by at least one other developer.
* **Review Criteria:** Reviewers will assess the code's correctness, readability, efficiency, and adherence to the project's coding style.
* **Feedback:** Reviewers will provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.  Authors are expected to address the feedback promptly and efficiently.
* **Approval:** Once all reviewers approve the changes, the pull request will be merged into the main branch.


This guide will be updated as the project evolves.  Feel free to suggest improvements and additions to this document.
