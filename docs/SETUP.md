## IntelliDocs Setup Guide

This guide outlines the setup and configuration of IntelliDocs, a hypothetical project with unspecified technologies.  Since no technologies are specified, we'll assume a general setup applicable to many projects, focusing on best practices.  You will need to adapt this guide based on the actual technologies used in your IntelliDocs project.

**1. Prerequisites:**

* **Operating System:**  Specify the supported OS (e.g., Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, Linux distributions like Ubuntu 20.04+).
* **Software:**
    * **(Specify based on technologies used):**  This might include a specific version of Python, Node.js, Java, .NET, a database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB), a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx), etc.  List these with specific version numbers if needed.
    * **Text Editor/IDE:**  A code editor or IDE like VS Code, Sublime Text, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse.
    * **Git (Recommended):** For version control.
    * **Package Manager:**  (e.g., npm, pip, Maven, Gradle)  Specify the relevant package manager based on the chosen technologies.


**2. Installation Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository (if applicable):** If IntelliDocs is hosted on a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), clone it using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd intellidocs
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:** Use the appropriate package manager to install the project's dependencies.  This step will vary greatly depending on the technologies used. Examples:
   * **Python (using pip):** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   * **Node.js (using npm):** `npm install`
   * **Maven (Java):** `mvn clean install`
   * **Gradle (Java):** `./gradlew build`
3. **Build the Application (if applicable):**  Some projects require a build step before running.  This might involve compiling code, creating executables, or generating static assets.  The specific commands will depend on the build system used (e.g., Make, CMake, webpack).

**3. Configuration:**

IntelliDocs likely requires configuration. This might involve creating configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config.ini`, `application.properties`) or modifying existing ones.  Common configuration settings might include:

* **Database Connection:**  Details about the database server (host, port, username, password, database name).
* **API Keys/Secrets:**  For external services like payment gateways or cloud providers.
* **Paths:** Locations of data files, logs, or other important directories.
* **Logging Level:**  The level of detail in the application's logs (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).

**4. Environment Setup:**

* **Virtual Environments (Recommended):**  Create a virtual environment to isolate the IntelliDocs project's dependencies from other projects. This prevents conflicts and ensures consistency. (e.g., `python3 -m venv .venv` for Python, `conda create -n intellidocs` for conda)
* **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information like API keys and database passwords as environment variables instead of hardcoding them in the configuration files.  This improves security.
* **Database Setup:** If IntelliDocs uses a database, create the necessary database and tables.  The exact steps depend on your chosen database system.


**5. Running the Application:**

The instructions for running IntelliDocs will depend entirely on its architecture.  Examples:

* **Web Application:** `npm start` or a similar command might start a development server.  Alternatively, you might need to deploy it to a web server like Apache or Nginx.
* **Desktop Application:** A simple command like `./intellidocs` or `java -jar intellidocs.jar` might launch the application.
* **Command-line Tool:** Running the main script directly (e.g., `python main.py`).


**6. Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

* **Dependency Errors:**  Ensure all required dependencies are installed and their versions are compatible. Check your package manager's output for error messages.
* **Configuration Errors:** Verify that your configuration files are correct and that environment variables are set properly.
* **Database Errors:**  Check your database connection details and ensure the database is running and accessible.
* **Runtime Errors:** Examine log files for error messages.  These often provide clues about the cause of the problem.  Use a debugger if necessary.
* **Missing Files/Directories:** Verify that all necessary files and directories are present in the project directory.



**Note:**  This is a template.  You **must** replace the placeholder information (operating systems, software, commands, etc.) with the specifics for your IntelliDocs project.  Without knowing the technologies used, this is the most generic and comprehensive setup guide possible. Remember to consult the project's own documentation if available.
