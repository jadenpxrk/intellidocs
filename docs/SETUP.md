## IntelliDocs Setup Guide

This guide outlines the setup and configuration for IntelliDocs, a hypothetical project with unspecified technologies.  Since no technologies are specified, we will assume a general approach suitable for many common scenarios.  You'll need to adapt this guide based on the actual technologies used in your IntelliDocs project.

**1. Prerequisites:**

* **Operating System:**  Specify the supported OS (e.g., Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, Linux distributions like Ubuntu 20.04+).  If there are specific OS versions required, mention them explicitly.
* **Programming Languages:** List all required programming languages (e.g., Python 3.9+, Java 17, Node.js 16+).  Include specific version requirements if necessary.
* **Development Tools:**  List required IDEs or text editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Sublime Text).  Specify any necessary extensions or plugins.
* **Database (if applicable):** Specify the database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) and its required version.  Include any client tools needed for interaction.
* **Web Server (if applicable):** If IntelliDocs is a web application, specify the required web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and its version.
* **Other Dependencies:** List any additional libraries, frameworks, or tools needed (e.g., specific Python packages, npm modules, etc.).

**2. Installation Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**  If the project is hosted on a version control system (like Git), clone the repository using: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**  For projects that use programming languages like Python, creating a virtual environment isolates project dependencies.  Use `python3 -m venv .venv` (or the equivalent for your language) to create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Use the project's package manager (e.g., `pip`, `npm`, `Maven`, `Gradle`) to install all necessary dependencies.  Typically, there will be a `requirements.txt` (Python), `package.json` (Node.js), or similar file specifying these dependencies.  Run the appropriate command (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
4. **Build the Application (if necessary):** Some projects require a build step before running.  Follow the project's instructions for building the application. This may involve using a build tool like `make`, `gradle`, or `maven`.


**3. Configuration:**

* **Database Configuration:** If a database is used, configure the database connection details (hostname, port, username, password, database name) in a configuration file (e.g., `config.ini`, `database.yml`, or environment variables).
* **API Keys and Credentials:** If the project uses external APIs or services, configure the necessary API keys, access tokens, or other credentials securely (e.g., in environment variables, a separate configuration file).  **Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly into the code.**
* **Server Configuration (if applicable):** If a web server is used, configure the web server to serve the application. This may involve configuring virtual hosts, ports, and other server settings.
* **Logging Configuration:** Configure logging levels and output destinations (e.g., console, file) to aid in debugging and monitoring.

**4. Environment Setup:**

* **Set Environment Variables:**  Use your operating system's tools to set necessary environment variables (e.g., `export DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url>` on Linux/macOS, `set DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url>` on Windows).  This is crucial for security and managing configuration values separately from the code.
* **Path Configuration:** Ensure that the necessary executables (e.g., the application's main executable, database clients) are in your system's PATH environment variable.


**5. Running the Application:**

Once all prerequisites are met and the application is configured, run the application using the instructions provided in the project's documentation. This might involve running a specific command (e.g., `python app.py`, `npm start`, `./run.sh`).


**6. Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

* **Dependency Errors:** Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible with each other. Check the project's documentation or error messages for guidance on resolving dependency conflicts.
* **Configuration Errors:**  Carefully review your configuration files and environment variables to ensure that all settings are correct.  Double-check typos and ensure file paths are accurate.
* **Database Connection Errors:**  Verify your database credentials and ensure that the database server is running and accessible.
* **Server Errors (if applicable):** If deploying to a web server, check the web server's logs for errors.
* **Runtime Errors:** Examine the application's logs or error messages for clues about runtime problems.

This guide provides a general framework. You must adapt it based on the specific technologies and instructions provided with your IntelliDocs project.  Always refer to the project's official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
